### a starter template for building web app with elixir phoenix backend, and solidjs frontend. 
This is still a wip. I'm making this simply because I used this combination for a previous webapp and it was so fun to use and very simple to implement both a rest api and socket 
connection that can be infinitely modyfied to suit whatever you need to build. I was about to start another project using the same stack and thought to myself, why don't I just make
a template of sorts so I don't have to rewrite the basic auth and reconfigure the socket server, etc. :)
